## **Advancing Patient Care with  VR-Based  Therapies**

VR technology is not limited to training;  it has also made significant inroads in patient care. VR-based therapies have demonstrated  promising results in alleviating pain, managing chronic conditions, and treating  mental health disorders. By immersing patients in  virtual environments tailored to their specific needs, VR therapy  offers a distraction from pain, reduces anxiety, and  facilitates relaxation. In mental health, VR  therapy provides immersive exposure therapy for phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), allowing patients to confront their fears in a controlled setting. VR-enabled rehabilitation programs also empower patients recovering from injuries or surgeries to engage in physical therapy exercises in a  gamified and motivating environment, accelerating  their recovery journey.
