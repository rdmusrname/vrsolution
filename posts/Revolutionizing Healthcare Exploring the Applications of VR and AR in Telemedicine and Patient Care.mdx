## Revolutionizing  Healthcare: Exploring the  Applications of VR and AR  in Telemedicine and Patient Care

The healthcare industry is undergoing a transformative revolution fueled by advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). These technologies have opened up a realm of possibilities revolutionizing the  way medical professionals deliver care and  patients experience treatment.

### Telemedicine: Breaking Down  Geographical Barriers

VR  and AR have emerged as powerful tools in telemedicine enabling remote healthcare providers to deliver quality care across vast distances. Patients can now receive specialized treatment consultations, and rehabilitation from the comfort of their homes.

One prominent application  is the use of robotic  exoskeletons and virtual environments for stroke rehabilitation. These systems provide personalized assessments and engaging therapy games, offering improved patient outcomes and increased  convenience.
